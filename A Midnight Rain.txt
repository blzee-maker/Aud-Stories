Title: A Midnight Conversation
Aarav and Saanvi sit on a quiet rooftop, the city lights twinkling below them. The breeze is cool, carrying the scent of rain. A single lantern flickers between them.
Aarav: You ever wonder what love really is?
Saanvi: [Smiling softly] Love is… a lot of things. Why? Did you fall in love with someone?
Aarav: Maybe. [Pauses, looking at her] Or maybe I’m just trying to understand what this feeling is.
Saanvi: Hmm… Is it the way your heart races when they look at you? Or how silence feels comfortable when they’re around?
Aarav: [Chuckles] That sounds too poetic.
Saanvi: Love is poetic, Aarav. It’s in the little things. Like when someone remembers how you take your coffee or listens to your nonsense at 2 AM.
Aarav: [Leaning back, looking at the sky] So… if I remember that you like your coffee with extra sugar but hate it too sweet… does that mean I—
Saanvi: [Interrupting] Maybe.
Aarav: And if I stay up, just to listen to you talk about constellations…?
Saanvi: [Grinning] Then you’re either in love or really bad at sleeping.
Aarav: [Laughs] Maybe both.
Saanvi: [Softly] Love is also in unsaid words, Aarav. In the way someone looks at you like you’re their favorite song.
Aarav: [Looks at her, voice quieter] And if I told you… you’re my favorite song?
Saanvi doesn’t reply immediately. Instead, she reaches for his hand, intertwining their fingers gently.
Saanvi: Then I’d tell you… I’ve been humming the same tune for a while now.
The lantern flickers again, but the warmth between them lingers—stronger than words, louder than the city below.
